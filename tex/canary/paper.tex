\section{Problem Statement}
Determine whether a graph $G$ has a minor isomorphic to $H$. 

\section{General Algorithm}
Start by considering all vertices in $G$ as unassigned.
Go through each vertex $h_k \in H$ and assign it to a vertex in $G$.
Then for each previously assigned vertex $h_j \in H$ that has an edge between $h_j$ and $h_k$ find a path in $G$ that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Starts at a vertex connected to a vertex assigned to $h_j$
\item Continues through vertices that may be assigned to $h_j$
\item Then through vertices that are unassigned
\item Then through vertices that may be assigned to $h_k$
\item Finally ends at a vertex connected to $h_k$
\end{enumerate}
The middle steps may contain $0$ vertices.

All vertices on the path that may be assigned to $h_j$ are then assigned to $h_j$,
  likewise all vertices on the path that may be assigned to $h_i$ are then assigned to $h_i$.
All unassigned vertices on the path may in the future be assigned to $h_j$ or to $h_i$.

Repeat until either the vertices and edges in $H$ are exhausted, or until no path is possible.
If no path is possible backtrack, trying a diffrent path or vertex assignment until all paths and assignments have been tried.

\section{Optimizations}
We can apply diffrent optimizations to speed up computation.
\subsection{Minimal Initial Assignment}
If $h_k$ was assigned to vertex $g \in G$, and then reassigned, then no future assignment need assign $g$ to $h_k$.
\subsection{Minimal Path Length}
If a path has connected vertices $g_i, g_k$ then the path should also contain the edge $g_i, g_k$.

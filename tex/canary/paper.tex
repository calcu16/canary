\section{Problem Statement}
Determine whether a graph $G$ has a minor isomorphic to $H$. 

\section{General Algorithm}
Start by considering all vertices in $G$ as unassigned.
Go through each vertex $h_k \in H$ and assign it to a vertex in $G$.
Then for each previously assigned vertex $h_j \in H$ that has an edge between $h_j$ and $h_k$ find a path in $G$ that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Starts at a vertex connected to a vertex assigned to $h_j$
\item Continues through vertices that may be assigned to $h_j$
\item Then through vertices that are unassigned
\item Then through vertices that may be assigned to $h_k$
\item Finally ends at a vertex connected to $h_k$
\end{enumerate}
The middle steps may contain $0$ vertices.

All vertices on the path that may be assigned to $h_j$ are then assigned to $h_j$,
  likewise all vertices on the path that may be assigned to $h_i$ are then assigned to $h_i$.
All unassigned vertices on the path may in the future be assigned to $h_j$ or to $h_i$.

Repeat until either the vertices and edges in $H$ are exhausted, or until no path is possible.
If no path is possible backtrack, trying a diffrent path or vertex assignment until all paths and assignments have been tried.

\section{Optimizations}
We can apply diffrent optimizations to speed up computation.
\subsection{Minimal Initial Assignment}
If $h_k$ was assigned to vertex $g \in G$, and then reassigned, then no future assignment need assign $g$ to $h_k$.
\subsection{Minimal Path Length}
If a path has connected vertices $g_i, g_k$ then the path should also contain the edge $g_i, g_k$.

\subsection{Minimal Path Length on Path Starts}
This can be extended to starting vertices, if vertex $g_j$ is assigned to $h_j$,
  and connected to $g_k$ which is on a path from $h_j$ to $h_k$.
Then the path should contain an edge from $g_j$ to $h_i$.

\subsection{Retroactive Minimal Path Length}
Furthermore if $g_j$ is not assigned to $h_j$, but instead may either be assigned to $h_j$ or $h_k$,
  then it follows that if $g_k$ is not connected to something assigned to $h_j$ then $g_j$ must be assigned to $h_k$.
Otherwise the previous optimization would be violated.

\end{figure}
In Figure \ref{fig:min path 3.1} nodes 1, 2, and 3 are all inital assignments for 3 different vertices in the minor.
 There is a path created between 1 and 2 as shown in magenta through vertices 6 and 4.
 Both vertices may be assigned to either 4 or 6.
 Similarly there is a path between 1 and 3 as shown in cyan through vertices 7 and 5.

\end{figure}
In Figure \ref{fig:min path 3.2} we see that if we were to assign 4 to vertex 1,
  that there would be a more minimal path from 1 to 3 which does not need to use vertex 7.

Therefore in the original position we must assign 4 to vertex 2, and likewise 5 is assigned vertex 3 as shown in Figure \ref{fig:min path 3.3}.
